# Blog Publishing

This folder documents how blog posts are managed.

1. Draft posts are written in Markdown inside `drafts/`.
2. Once reviewed, move the file to `published/` with the date in the filename.
3. During deployment these Markdown files are converted to Shopify articles.

If no Markdown posts exist yet, start by creating a file under `drafts/` using the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
