# Clients

This directory contains project files for each client we work with. Every
client gets its own folder under `clients/` with subdirectories for contracts,
design work, meeting notes and any website projects.

## Adding a new client

Run `./tools/create-structure.sh` and provide the client name when prompted.
The script creates the standard subfolders so you can start adding files right
away.

For a complete overview of the expected folder tree, see
[docs/folder-structure.txt](../docs/folder-structure.txt).
