# Launch Strategy

COMMA will push merchandise and digital products across multiple channels:

- **Shopify:** Primary storefront for all merch and digital downloads. Use Shopify apps for inventory, discounts and cross-channel sync.
- **Meta (Instagram/Facebook Shops):** Sync catalog from Shopify to enable in-app purchases and shoppable posts.
- **TikTok Shopping:** Link products directly in video content and ads through TikTok's shopping integration.
- **Google Shopping:** Submit product feed to reach search users and run paid Shopping campaigns.
- **Pinterest:** Create pins for each product and leverage Pinterest shopping ads.
- **Email Marketing:** Build segmented lists in Klaviyo/Mailchimp to announce drops and offer exclusive deals.

Complement paid ads with influencer outreach and an affiliate program to amplify reach. Consistent blogging focused on SEO keywords will drive organic traffic over time.
