# Moodboard

Visual identity draws from cosmic imagery and technicolor gradients. Think starfields, lens flares and futuristic typography. The moodboard mixes old-school trance flyers with clean modern layouts.

Designers should emphasise motion and light – swirling nebula textures combined with sleek sans-serif type. Avoid retro rave clichés; keep it polished and forward-focused.
