# DECO 5000: Oslo-based Trance Artist 

## Background & Style 
**DECO 5000** is a trance music project from Oslo, Norway, known for its high-energy yet melodic sound. The alias was created by Herman Marensius Gjersøe as an outlet for trance, distinct from his progressive house work under “Marensius”. DECO 5000’s style blends nostalgic 90s/00s trance euphoria with modern production – described as **fast, euphoric, and emotionally intense** trance with a contemporary edge. Often dubbed part of the “neotrance” wave, the DECO 5000 sound balances uplifting melodies and driving beats. This unique sonic palette – nicknamed the “5K experience” – has quickly gained attention for **its nostalgic trance energy fused with modern uptempo drive**.
