# DECO 5000 – Brand Research

## Background & Style
DECO 5000 is a trance project from Oslo created by Herman Marensius Gjersøe as an outlet for high‑energy, melodic trance. The music blends nostalgic 90s/00s euphoria with modern production techniques and is often described as part of the "neotrance" wave. Supporters call the sound the "5K experience" for its fast, emotive drive. Signed to the Oslo label COMMA., DECO 5000 released a debut EP with the label in 2025 after several independent singles and appearances on international compilations. The project actively engages listeners on SoundCloud and Instagram, drawing attention for uplifting melodies and energetic grooves.

Beyond solo releases, DECO 5000 has appeared on various DJ mixes and playlists, including the Epiphany podcast and Streetbackboys sets. Remixes for other artists are minimal so far, with the focus on original material and select collaborations such as the TDJ feature in 2024.

## Live Performances
- **Musikkfest Oslo 2024** – delivered a rooftop set on the Streetbackboys stage at Rockefeller, earning "performer of the day" honours. Invited back as a headliner for Musikkfest 2025.
- **Support for Function (Sept 2024)** – opened for the techno legend at an Oslo club event, bringing high‑BPM trance energy to a darker crowd.
- **Streetbackboys events** – regular appearances at the collective’s parties, including their 5th anniversary and other club nights, noted for balancing nostalgic trance with uptempo progressive elements.
- **Local showcases** – frequent sets at Oslo venues through COMMA. gatherings and other promoters, testing new material in intimate settings.

All performances to date have been in Norway, though DECO 5000’s music has reached listeners worldwide through digital releases.

## Brand Outlook
The DECO 5000 identity leans into futuristic and cosmic visuals, mirroring the theme of journeying beyond ordinary reality. Under COMMA.’s guidance the project maintains a clear boundary from the artist’s other aliases while cultivating a consistent trance brand. Future plans focus on expanding into Germany, France and South America with an emphasis on immersive live shows and continued growth on streaming platforms.
