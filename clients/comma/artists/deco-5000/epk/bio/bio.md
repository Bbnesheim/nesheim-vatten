DECO 5000 is a trance project from Oslo created by Herman Marensius Gjers√∏e. The music blends nostalgic 90s/00s euphoria with modern production and is often described as part of the "neotrance" wave. Supporters call the sound the "5K experience" for its fast, emotive drive. Signed to COMMA., DECO 5000 released a debut EP in 2025 after several independent singles and appearances on international compilations. The project actively engages listeners on SoundCloud and Instagram, drawing attention for uplifting melodies and energetic grooves.
