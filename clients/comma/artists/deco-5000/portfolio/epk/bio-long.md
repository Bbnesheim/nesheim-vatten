DECO 5000 emerged from Oslo’s DIY scene, combining classic trance sensibilities with futuristic sound design. After early singles like "She Left in the Morning" and the collaborative *Drifting with Tommy* EP, he honed a style of fast, euphoric tracks anchored by emotional melodies. The 2025 release *Decosystema Vol. 1* solidified his place as COMMA.’s flagship artist. Live, DECO 5000 pairs high-BPM sets with synchronised visuals, creating an immersive "5K experience" that resonates with club audiences across Scandinavia. Future plans focus on Germany, France and South America.
