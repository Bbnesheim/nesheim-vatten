DECO 5000 emerged from Oslo’s DIY scene, fusing nostalgic trance hooks with futuristic sound design. Early singles such as "She Left in the Morning" and the *Drifting with Tommy* EP paved the way for 2025’s *Decosystema Vol. 1*, which cemented him as COMMA.’s flagship act. On stage, the 5K experience pairs high-BPM sets with reactive visuals, inviting crowds into an emotional rush of colour and melody. Looking ahead, DECO 5000 aims to expand his euphoric sound throughout Germany, France and South America.
