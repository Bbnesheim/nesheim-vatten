# Marensius – Artist Profile and Discography

## Overview
Marensius (real name **Herman Marensius Gjersøe**) is a Norwegian electronic producer focused on progressive house. He debuted the alias in 2025 with the *Iris EP* on the newly launched COMMA. label, collaborating with Hovland. Though a new name, Marensius previously built an audience in the underground trance scene as **DECO 5000**, a faster, euphoric project with several releases and hundreds of thousands of streams. This dual identity allows him to draw from both progressive house and classic trance.

## Background and Artistic Evolution
- **Early career as DECO 5000 (2021–2024):** released hard‑trance and techno tracks such as *Drifting With Tommy* (2022, Mhost Likely) and "Cosmic Sense" (2022, Groove Estate). Continued releasing singles like "Dyonis" (2023, Atom Trance Force) and collaborating with artists including TDJ on "Blue Skies" (2024).
- **Shift to Marensius (2024–present):** joined forces with Hovland and a collective of Oslo producers to form COMMA., providing a home for genre‑blending music. The first Marensius material arrived with the *Iris EP* (2025), followed by the solo single "For This Moment" (2025). He keeps elements of the energetic 5k sound while focusing on slower, melodic arrangements.

## Style and Influences
Marensius emphasizes atmosphere and melody. His progressive house tracks blend lush pads, arpeggiated synths and groove‑driven bass lines. Influences range from 2010s melodic innovators like Jeremy Olander and Sébastien Léger to late‑90s trance, which informs his DECO 5000 work. Tracks are refined through live testing in Oslo clubs, resulting in a dancefloor‑oriented, emotional style.
