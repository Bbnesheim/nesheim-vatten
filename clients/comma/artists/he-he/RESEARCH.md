HE:HE Launch Strategy & Market Research Report
Positioning & Identity

Comparative Landscape: HE:HE (the duo of Herman Hovland and Herman “Marensius” Gjersøe) sits at the intersection of progressive house and trance. Similar artist duos and collectives blending melodic club music with strong branding provide a benchmark for HE:HE’s positioning. For example, KREAM, a Norwegian brother duo, have achieved global success by marrying deep club grooves with pop-savvy hooks – appealing to both underground and mainstream audiences
dstrktfest.com
dstrktfest.com
. In the progressive/melodic sphere, acts like Tinlicker or CamelPhat have built followings through emotive, evolving tracks and memorable two-person identities. Tale Of Us (with their Afterlife label) exemplify how a duo can craft a distinct visual and sonic world around melodic techno. These references show that duos who cultivate a clear ethos and aesthetic – whether it’s KREAM’s “club edits meets viral remixes” approach or Tale Of Us’s cinematic visual identity – tend to stand out.

HE:HE’s Unique Identity: What sets HE:HE apart is the fusion of the two Hermans’ backgrounds into a cohesive brand. Hovland brings a “driving, progressive energy” and patient, groove-oriented build-ups
dotcomma.store
, while Marensius contributes playful melodies and trance-influenced uplift
dotcomma.store
. Their debut “Iris EP” was praised for drawing “a perfect line” between Marensius’s melodic playfulness and Hovland’s progressive drive
dotcomma.store
. In practice, this means HE:HE’s sound can span from emotive, melody-rich anthems to club-ready progressive workouts – a versatility that few duos offer. Additionally, both members have established credibility individually: Hovland’s prior projects (Von Dahl, Violand) earned significant streams and DJ support (e.g. 150K+ streams on “Antarctica” and nods from Miss Monique)
dotcomma.store
, while Marensius’s alias DECO 5000 amassed hundreds of thousands of streams in the trance scene
dotcomma.store
. This dual heritage (progressive house and trance) positions HE:HE to brand themselves as a “5k experience” – a term they’ve used to describe their high-resolution, multi-sensory approach – essentially progressive trance for the modern era.

Branding Implications: HE:HE’s name itself (pronounced “he-he”) is short, memorable, and reflects the duo nature (two “He”’s, hinting at both members named Herman). Visually, the “HE:HE” brand can play on symmetry and duality – e.g. a mirrored logo with the colon as a central motif. The duo’s identity should emphasize collaboration and unity: their story (two close collaborators refining tracks together on a couch, then testing them in clubs
dotcomma.store
dotcomma.store
) is an authentic narrative to build on. They should highlight how “the crowd became part of the process” in crafting their music
dotcomma.store
dotcomma.store
– conveying an ethos of community-driven creativity. In a market full of solo DJs, this duo can brand itself as greater than the sum of its parts, blending two creative minds into one fresh act.

Actionable Positioning Steps: To solidify HE:HE’s identity:

    Craft a succinct tagline (for press kits and bios) that highlights their Oslo roots, dual nature, and melodic-progressive style (e.g. “HE:HE – Two minds, one progressive melodic journey”).

    Develop a visual identity system around the name: for instance, a minimalist logo with the “:” symbol, and a monochrome or neon palette echoing COMMA’s underground aesthetic. Ensure it aligns with COMMA’s clean, modern design while giving HE:HE a distinctive mark.

    Position HE:HE as innovators in the progressive scene. In communications, reference their use of virtual environments and live visual art (HE:HE have already integrated virtual stage design in shows
    facebook.com
    ) to underscore a tech-forward, immersive brand.

    Benchmark against duos like the above: emphasize what HE:HE offers that others don’t. For example, unlike some trance acts that stick to formula, HE:HE will champion genre-bending freedom (“no compromise on our sound” as Hovland said of their label ethos
    dotcomma.store
    ). This uniqueness can be branded by using phrases like “progressive without borders” or “melodic music with no limits,” reinforcing that HE:HE’s artistry spans styles.

    Highlight their role as co-founders of COMMA. This adds credibility (showing they are building a community/label, not just making tracks) and positions them among artist-entrepreneurs like the Soulection or Kitsuné crews. Much like Maison Kitsuné blends a music label with a fashion line
    10corsocomo.com
    youtube.com
    , HE:HE and COMMA together hint at a holistic creative brand (music, events, apparel).

By carving out this identity – a duo of visionary Oslo producers pushing melodic progressive sounds with a high-tech, artsy twist – HE:HE can occupy a clear lane in the market that resonates with fans seeking authenticity and innovation.
Target Audience

Ideal Fan Profile: HE:HE’s target audience will likely mirror the demographics of modern progressive house and trance enthusiasts. Primarily, we’re looking at young adults 18–35 with a passion for electronic music. Geographically, initial fans will be in Norway and Scandinavia (given the duo’s Oslo base and local following), but the sound has global appeal for fans of Anjunadeep-style progressive, melodic techno, and festival trance. Psychographically, these fans are experience-driven and community-oriented – they value the “journey” of a DJ set and the emotional highs of melodic tracks. They are the type to attend all-night club events or festivals for the collective euphoria. Many will be music-savvy creators themselves (DJs, producers, or content creators), or at least highly engaged listeners who curate playlists and follow labels.

Subcultural Alignment: This audience overlaps with subcultures like the progressive trance family, Anjunabeats/Anjunadeep communities, and the broader festival-goer culture. They might also intersect with the tech-forward creative crowd – people who enjoy digital art and might be into gaming or crypto – since HE:HE’s concept involves virtual art and high-tech visuals
facebook.com
. Notably, Herman Marensius’s background in the “Skammekroquen” and “OC/DC” collectives
dotcomma.store
suggests ties to local underground crews; their fans are likely tastemakers in the scene, embracing cutting-edge sounds. Internationally, think of fans of acts like Above & Beyond, Yotto, or Rüfüs Du Sol – musically open-minded, emotionally invested, and willing to follow artists across mediums (from Twitch streams to live shows to merch drops).

Where They Spend Time – Online: The ideal fans are digitally native. They spend significant time on:

    Instagram & TikTok: Scrolling for festival after-movies, DJ memes, and short music clips. TikTok in particular is booming for electronic music – usage of #ElectronicMusic content grew 70% YoY, with #Trance video creations up 73%
    routenote.com
    . This means HE:HE’s core genres are trending on TikTok, and fans are actively engaging with short-form DJ content. They likely follow accounts that post live set highlights or behind-the-scenes studio clips. Instagram remains key for event photos, stories, and visual branding; progressive house fans often follow artist pages for updates on releases and tour dates.

    Spotify & YouTube: These fans consume music voraciously on streaming. They follow curated playlists (e.g. Spotify’s “Progressive House” or “Trance Classics”) and watch YouTube channels like Progressive Astronaut or Cercle. Many discovered Hovland & Marensius via YouTube or SoundCloud DJ set recordings, and indeed HE:HE’s own BTS footage from a KREAM afterparty was promoted on YouTube
dotcomma.store
dotcomma.store
. We should assume our audience checks YouTube for live set videos and algorithmically recommended tracks.

    Discord & Reddit: The more community-engaged segment hangs out in Discord servers (for labels like Anjunadeep or Monstercat, or genre-based servers) and subreddits like r/ProgressiveHouse or r/aves. Here they discuss new releases, share event experiences, and sometimes get insider info directly from artists. Early adopters of HE:HE may already be in COMMA.’s orbit via its socials; fostering a Discord for COMMA/HE:HE could tap into this.

    Niche Platforms: A subset of this audience is on Bandcamp (to support artists directly) and possibly on emerging platforms like Audius or Soundcloud (for discovering unreleased tracks and sets). They might follow Bandcamp Daily or indie music blogs to find fresh music beyond mainstream channels.

Where They Spend Time – Physical: In real life, these fans frequent clubs and festivals. Locally, they are the regulars at Oslo’s venues like The Villa (the “Sweatshop” basement nights)
dotcomma.store
, Bla, or Jaeger – places known for underground electronic nights. They also attend regional festivals (e.g. Sommerøya in Norway, or possibly international gatherings like Amsterdam Dance Event, Tomorrowland, etc. as aspirational events). They hang out at record stores or streetwear shops that cater to music fans, and at art/tech events (since visuals and music often intersect for this crowd). They may also be found at pop-ups or afterparties – for instance, HE:HE fans showed up at the KREAM afterparty to catch the duo’s set
dotcomma.store
. In short, nightlife hubs and music festivals are their social playground.

Consumption Behaviors: This audience’s consumption extends beyond just listening:

    Music: They stream extensively (often premium subscribers on Spotify/Apple Music for better quality and no ads). They love discovering new tracks – likely to save HE:HE’s songs to their personal playlists and share them with friends. Some are old-school enough to buy vinyl or high-quality downloads for support, especially if HE:HE offers a Bandcamp exclusive. They also consume DJ mixes/podcasts (e.g. Group Therapy, Future Sound of Egypt) which shape their taste.

    Fashion: Many identify with the “raver” or clubber style – comfortable streetwear often in black or neon, sometimes sporting brand logos from labels (Anjunadeep hoodies, Afterlife tees, etc.). If COMMA. sells apparel, these fans could be customers of the COMMA.cap or hoodie. They appreciate merch that represents the scene subtly yet stylishly. This means HE:HE merch could be integrated into their wardrobe if it aligns with streetwear aesthetics.

    Tech & Art: Given HE:HE’s integration of digital art, the fans likely enjoy technology – perhaps VR showcases, interactive visuals at shows, and even NFTs/art collectibles if done tastefully. They probably use high-end headphones or sound systems at home (they care about the sonic quality). They might dabble in music production or visual design themselves, implying they respond well to content like production tips or visual art shares from the duo.

    Community Engagement: They’re joiners – willing to participate in fan communities, respond to polls, enter remix contests, etc. If HE:HE runs a Discord event or AMA, this group will turn up. They value feeling involved with the artist’s journey.

By understanding that our target fans are digitally savvy music explorers who live for club culture and share a strong sense of community, we can tailor HE:HE’s outreach to meet them where they are. The key is to strike authenticity – this crowd can sense when something is overly commercial. They respond to genuine storytelling (e.g. hearing how “Iris” had 11 revisions based on crowd feedback
dotcomma.store
dotcomma.store
resonates with their own love of the dancefloor). By engaging these fans on the platforms and places they frequent, HE:HE can cultivate a loyal base that will act as evangelists for the duo’s music and brand.
Market Trends & Cultural Signals

Emerging Music Trends: The timing for HE:HE’s launch aligns with several exciting movements in music and culture:

    Progressive House & Trance Resurgence: After a period in the 2010s where big-room EDM and techno dominated, there’s a noted revival of melodic progressive sounds. Young producers are reincorporating 90s/00s trance elements (soaring pads, emotional melodies) into modern arrangements. This “neo-trance” trend is visible in the surge of #Trance content on TikTok (73% growth in videos
    routenote.com
    ) and the popularity of melodic techno at festivals. HE:HE’s music – described as “melodic, progressive, but always evolving”
    dotcomma.store
    – is perfectly placed to ride this wave. Their track “Iris,” which elicited huge crowd reactions in clubs
dotcomma.store
    , reflects how audiences crave that big melodic payoff on the dancefloor again. Culturally, this could tie into a post-pandemic desire for euphoria and unity – people want emotionally uplifting tracks that bring communal joy, a space HE:HE can fill.

    Hybrid Genres & Experimentation: Audiences are increasingly open to genre-blending. We see house tracks with trance breakdowns topping charts, techno DJs dropping breakbeats – rigid genre boundaries are eroding. HE:HE has explicitly stated they don’t want to be “boxed into a specific genre or formula”
    dotcomma.store
    . This flexibility aligns with the trend of artists defying labels (for instance, labels like Anjunadeep release ambient, breaks, and prog under one roof; DJs like Charlotte de Witte dabble in acid trance remixes). HE:HE can position themselves at this cutting edge, as an act that might drop a progressive house tune one moment and a trance 5k banger the next, surprising and delighting fans who pride themselves on eclectic taste.

    Immersive Live Experiences: There’s a growing expectation for visual and experiential elements in music events. Collectives like HØR Berlin gained fame by curating a distinctive vibe (their raw, bathroom-tiled livestream aesthetic) and offering live chat/community during sets. Fans now value not just the music but the context – visuals, environments, narratives. HE:HE and the COMMA team are already tapping into this: their releases are paired with virtual environments by visual artists (Ola Vatten & Bendik Nesheim crafted a “powerful virtual environment” for a COMMA event
    facebook.com
    ). This trend of audiovisual integration means HE:HE should continue to emphasize their 5K visual identity, potentially doing things like VR concert snippets, LED wall custom content, or interactive lighting that syncs with their set. By being early adopters of tech (AR filters for fans, or NFT art tied to tracks), they can signal that HE:HE is not just music, it’s a full sensory brand – exactly what modern audiences are gravitating toward.

    Local Culture, Global Reach: There’s a pride and interest in local scenes feeding into global music culture. Oslo’s electronic scene, while small, is on the radar (e.g. recent international coverage of Norwegian acts like KREAM, or the success of Norway’s Kygo in a different genre). HE:HE can capitalize on being distinctly Oslo (playing at venues like The Villa, collaborating with local talent) while projecting outward. The cultural signal here is authenticity: being true to your roots. Audiences globally often find that intriguing – think of how Berlin’s techno scene or Stockholm’s house scene carry cachet. If HE:HE showcases a bit of Nordic flavor (perhaps naming tracks after local spots like “Ekeberg” – which they did
dotcomma.store
    – or showcasing Oslo cityscapes in visuals), they tap into the “glocal” trend: globally minded but locally grounded artistry.

    DIY and Collective Ethos: A historical reference that feels relevant is the 90s rave ethos – PLUR (Peace Love Unity Respect) and the idea of collectives throwing their own parties. While times have changed, the independent spirit is back via artists starting their own labels and communities (Soulection, for example, built a global community with a radio show and events, not waiting for major label backing
    vice.com
    youtube.com
    ). HE:HE launching COMMA. is very much in line with this movement. They explicitly state COMMA is “a home for like-minded artists” and not just another party promoter
dotcomma.store
dotcomma.store
    . This taps into cultural signals of community-building and authenticity over commercialization. Many young fans prefer to support an indie collective where they feel part of the story, rather than a faceless corporate event. HE:HE can emphasize their collective’s vision and invite fans into the journey (through social media transparency, crowd input on sets, etc.), riding the wave of this DIY collective trend.

Key References & Movements: In developing HE:HE’s strategy, we can draw on or position against specific movements:

    Align with the Anjunadeep/Anjunabeats legacy: These labels fostered communities around melodic EDM and could be seen as trailblazers for what HE:HE is doing in 2025. Citing their artists or even engaging with that fanbase (e.g. guest mix on Anjunadeep Edition podcast) could anchor HE:HE in a respected continuum.

    Take inspiration from Soulection: as mentioned, Soulection turned a collective mindset into a lifestyle brand with global reach (radio, live shows, clothing)
    youtube.com
    . HE:HE/COMMA can model some approaches here – e.g. curating compilation albums featuring friends (like Soulection’s White Label series) or hosting club nights that are more than just DJ sets (maybe combining art installations or talks).

    Subvert the mainstage EDM formula: While aligning with progressive/trance resurgence, HE:HE can deliberately distance itself from the clichés of commercial EDM (e.g. formulaic drops, over-the-top pyrotechnics). Their messaging can stress artistry and “evolving journeys” over cheap thrills. This positions them a bit like the anti-EDM duo, more akin to underground darlings (while still being accessible). Historically, movements like the techno underground in the early 2010s set themselves apart from the EDM boom; similarly HE:HE can be the melodic answer to that – delivering big moments but with credibility.

    Embrace the festival live-stream culture: The pandemic and post-pandemic era saw platforms like Boiler Room, Cercle, and HØR explode. Fans now regularly watch streamed sets and treat them almost as music videos. HE:HE can lean into this by doing special live-streamed performances from unique locations (an Oslo landmark perhaps) or thematic streams (like a set in 5K resolution with reactive visuals). By referencing the Cercle-style approach (Cercle streams DJs in stunning locations) or HØR’s grittier approach, they can signal that they’re part of the contemporary cultural fabric of electronic music dissemination.

In summary, HE:HE stands at the nexus of a melodic revival and a tech-art immersion era. By staying aware of these trends – and in fact, by making them part of HE:HE’s brand DNA – the duo can ensure their project feels timely and forward-thinking. They should consistently scan the horizon: what new visual tech are DJs using? What sounds are emerging from Berlin, London, LA that could complement theirs? By both aligning with positive currents (e.g. community-centric branding, genre fluidity) and differentiating from outdated modes (generic EDM, stagnant visuals), HE:HE can position itself as a leader in the cultural landscape.
Digital Strategy

A robust digital strategy will be crucial for HE:HE to build an early fanbase and grow beyond the local scene. Below we outline platform-specific approaches and tactics for virality and retention, informed by what’s working for similar acts:

TikTok & Short-Form Video: TikTok is currently one of the most impactful platforms for electronic music exposure. Electronic music content is booming – electronic genre videos have overtaken even indie music on TikTok
musictech.com
. For HE:HE, the key is leveraging short, captivating clips:

    Post live drop moments: Fans love experiencing festival-like moments on TikTok. HE:HE can share 15-30 second clips of their biggest track climaxes or crowd reactions from their shows. For example, a video of that peak moment when “Iris” drops and the crowd at The Villa goes wild can resonate widely (similar clips of festival drops often rack up views). TikTok notes that fans “post clips from their favourite live sets, which are then watched and shared in their millions”
    routenote.com
    . HE:HE should tap into this by making sure to capture high-quality footage at each gig.

    Behind-the-Scenes & Personality: Short humorous or personal clips can humanize the duo. Perhaps a TikTok of the two Hermans in the studio tweaking a synth (with a funny VO like “11 versions later… this is Iris”), or quick takes like “Rate our favorite trance classics” challenge. DJs like Hannah Laing have grown on TikTok by sharing DJ life snippets and behind-the-decks footage
    routenote.com
    . HE:HE can emulate this, showing their friendship and creative process, which invites fans into their world.

    Trends & Challenges: If any of HE:HE’s tracks have a distinct hook or melody, they can encourage a trend – e.g. a dance challenge or a scenic video challenge set to the track. Even if not going viral globally, getting a niche #IrisEP challenge going among their community helps algorithm visibility. Also engaging with trending sounds (remixing a viral meme tune into progressive style for fun) can show their playful side and catch algorithm waves.

    Frequency and hashtags matter: Aim for a consistent posting schedule (e.g. 3-4 TikToks a week) around relevant hashtags: #ElectronicMusic (which TikTok curates)
    routenote.com
    , #ProgressiveHouse, #Trance, #MelodicTechno etc., to get into those discovery hubs.

Instagram: Instagram remains essential for building brand aesthetic and deeper engagement:

    Visual storytelling: Use IG feed for high-quality photos – press shots of the duo, live photos from events (crowd shots, close-ups at the decks), and graphic announcements (release covers, event flyers). This establishes HE:HE’s visual identity (moody club photography, perhaps with that monochrome COMMA style).

    Reels: The advantage on IG is Reels can double-dip content from TikTok. Posting the same short videos on IG Reels will catch those who aren’t on TikTok. Given Reels’ algorithm, a well-edited 30-second clip of HE:HE dropping a track at 5 AM with the crowd in a frenzy could go viral or at least attract new followers.

    Stories for day-to-day: Use Instagram Stories to keep engagement: polls (“Which track should we open with tonight?”), quick updates (“On our way to the studio – send us vibe suggestions!”), and reposting fan stories (user-generated content from shows). This keeps fans feeling connected daily. Tag venues, collaborators, and use location tags (e.g. Oslo, #TheVilla) to reach local audiences too.

    IG Live / Q&A: Doing an occasional Instagram Live where Hovland & Marensius chat, answer questions or do a live mini-set can strengthen loyalty. Similar up-and-coming acts have found success by making themselves accessible on live video – it creates a personal bond.

Discord & Community Platforms: For retention and fostering a core community, launching a Discord server (or a similar community hub) early on is highly recommended:

    Discord Server: Create a COMMA/HE:HE Discord where fans can gather. Dedicate channels for topics: #general (introductions, off-topic chat), #music (discuss tracks, share favorite releases), #live-events (meetups and event chat), and exclusive channels for any members/patrons (if we implement memberships later). Encourage fans to join by promoting the Discord link on all socials (“Join our Discord to chat with us and get first news!”). Once inside, engage regularly: the duo can drop in snippets of unreleased music for feedback, or simply hang out in a voice channel monthly. This mirrors what some labels (Monstercat, bitbird, etc.) have done to great effect – building a family vibe in Discord.

    Fan feedback & exclusives: Use the community to test ideas (e.g. poll the Discord on two merch design options, or ask for input on what city to tour next). This not only yields valuable insight but makes fans feel heard – increasing their emotional investment. For example, HE:HE could share two 1-minute WIP clips and let the community vote which to finish; the winning track becomes a “Discord exclusive” free download for them before official release.

    Moderation & roles: As it grows, empower super-fans as moderators or give them special roles (like “5K Crew” for those who’ve been to 5+ events, etc.). Gamifying involvement keeps people around (maybe a leveling system for participation that leads to rewards like guest list spots).

    Collaboration via community: Consider hosting a remix contest or fan art contest on Discord. Similar acts have run remix contests where the stems are provided and winners get an official release or merch prize. This sparks UGC and buzz. Given Marensius’s producer collective history, tapping into that collaborative spirit will attract budding producers to the community.

Bandcamp & Direct-to-Fan: While streaming is the main consumption method, Bandcamp can cater to super-fans:

    Exclusive releases: HE:HE could drop an exclusive Bandcamp-only track or live edit occasionally, perhaps under a “pay-what-you-want” model. This caters to fans who want to support financially and get something rare. It could be a live recording from a club set or an ambient remix of an existing track. This also creates a sense of rarity and collectors’ appeal in an age where everything is on Spotify.

    Merch integration: Bandcamp allows selling merch and bundling with music. For example, sell a limited edition “Iris EP” cassette or USB that comes with a digital download and a small zine about the EP’s story. This sort of product appeals to hardcore supporters and can generate word-of-mouth (since it’s novel).

    Bandcamp Fridays: On Bandcamp Fridays (when the platform waives fees), consider doing something special – a new demo upload or a discount code for merch. Promote it as “support the artist day” to galvanize the fans who want to contribute beyond streaming.

Spotify & Streaming Platforms: Success on Spotify/Apple Music is ultimately critical for reach:

    Playlist Strategy: Work to get HE:HE tracks into key playlists. Besides editorial playlists (which may come as they build traction), focus on user-curated and algorithmic playlists. Submit tracks via Spotify for Artists to editorial before release. Additionally, identify influential independent playlists (with tens of thousands of followers) in progressive/trance and reach out (some curators might add if approached politely or via channels like Submithub).

    Spotify Canvas & Clips: Utilize Spotify’s features like Canvas (the looping 8-second video) on each track – for instance, a trippy visual snippet of their virtual 5K environment could loop behind “Transit” or “Iris”. This enhances the listener’s experience and shows professionalism. Also use Spotify’s Storylines or Clips (short artist message videos) to share anecdotes about each song – e.g. “We wrote Ekeberg during a half-time break watching football – you can even hear that playful spontaneity in the groove!
    dotcomma.store
    ” as a caption. These personal touches might increase shares and saves.

    Pre-saves & Algorithms: Every release should be preceded by a pre-save campaign (COMMA already did one for Iris EP
dotcomma.store
    ). Encourage fans (via IG/Discord) to pre-save, as this boosts algorithmic placement on release radar and discover weekly. Post-release, drive as many saves and playlist adds as possible in the first week – maybe incentivize by saying “screenshot your library with our song saved and we’ll pick 5 people for a merch code.”

    Collaborative Playlists: Create a “HE:HE & Friends Favorites” playlist on Spotify, including their tracks and tracks they love from other artists. Update it regularly and promote it. This not only gives fans insight into their influences (building personality) but might attract listeners searching for those other artists. For retention, being present in a listener’s playlists frequently is key – so a lively, updated playlist can keep HE:HE in their rotation.

Virality & Early Fanbase Tactics: Beyond platform specifics, some overarching tactics to spark virality and retention:

    Content Series: Establish recurring content that fans look forward to. E.g., “Techno Tuesday Tips” – a short video every Tuesday of them in studio showing a cool synth riff (using one of their track elements). Or a “Flashback Friday” where they share a classic trance track that inspired them via a quick Reels/TikTok. Regular series can hook followers and also potentially catch on if one installment goes viral.

    Cross-Promotion: Work with other artists/creators to cross-promote. Perhaps do a TikTok collab with OLING (the Swedish DJ they played with) where each posts a clip tagging the other. Or partner with a popular music influencer – e.g. a YouTuber who breaks down electronic tracks could feature an HE:HE song in a video. Early on, tapping adjacent audiences is crucial.

    Memes and Relatable Posts: Don’t underestimate lighthearted content. A meme about the “two Hermans” or a skit about Oslo club nights can humanize the brand. If something meme-y lands well, it can travel far in fan communities (Reddit, etc.). For instance, a funny clip of them confusingly responding when someone shouts “Herman!” backstage (since both are Herman) – could go viral within the scene for its uniqueness.

    Email Newsletter: Old-school but effective for retention. Capture emails via a signup on dotcomma.store or Linktree (perhaps offer a free download in exchange). A monthly newsletter can share upcoming shows, release news, maybe a personal note from the duo. Email ensures reach even if algorithms fail, and can be tailored (e.g. segment by city to announce local gigs).

    Data and Iteration: Pay attention to analytics – which TikTok got the most likes? What Instagram post had most saves? Use that to refine content strategy. Early fanbase building is an experiment, so doubling down on what resonates (e.g. if studio tips get low engagement but live clips soar, focus on live clips) will accelerate growth.

Tools/Platforms for Community & Activation: In addition to Discord and social media, consider:

    Twitch or YouTube Live: Live-streaming DJ sets or production sessions periodically. Even a low-key “Sunday Set in our living room” on Twitch could draw in a core group (artists like Ben Böhmer did home streams during lockdown that greatly boosted their following). These platforms also allow direct fan chat during the stream, deepening engagement.

    Patreon or Membership: Possibly down the line, a Patreon could be introduced for the most devoted fans – offering perks like monthly unreleased track demos, Patreon-only Discord channel, early access to tickets, etc. Many independent artists sustain themselves early on with a small base of paying superfans. The key is to have enough exclusive value that fans feel it’s worth it. Given COMMA’s small scale right now, this might be a plan for a year out once the base is established.

    Collaboration Platforms: If doing remix contests or collabs, platforms like Metapop or Audius could be utilized to host contests or drop stems in a web3 context. Not essential, but keeps HE:HE associated with cutting-edge ways to engage producers.

In executing this digital strategy, consistency and authenticity are paramount. Regularly appearing on fans’ feeds with valuable or entertaining content will keep HE:HE top-of-mind, while authentic interactions (responding to comments, engaging in Discord chats) will convert casual listeners into true fans. By studying what works for peers – from Boiler Room’s apparel-driven content strategy to Monstercat’s Twitch streams – and applying it in a way that fits HE:HE’s persona, the duo can achieve both virality for growth and community-building for retention.
Brand & Merch Opportunities

Visual Language: HE:HE’s visual identity should complement their sound – futuristic, polished, yet rooted in club culture. The COMMA.store and brand so far lean minimal and monochrome, reflecting an underground vibe. HE:HE can extend this aesthetic with their own twist:

    Incorporate the “: motif from HE:HE into graphics. For instance, promotional materials might use mirrored layouts or dual imagery to represent the duo. A simple but effective logo could be “HE:HE” in a bold, modern font with the colon perhaps stylized (imagine two dots like two eyes, implying two individuals in one).

    Embrace high-contrast, digital art elements: since their shows use virtual environments, that style (glowing wireframes, 3D landscapes, neon accents) can carry into cover art and visuals. The Iris EP cover and promo images could set a precedent – if any theme of an iris (eye or the flower) was used, building on that imagery in a consistent way helps brand recognition.

    Color palette: COMMA has been black/white-heavy. HE:HE might introduce a signature color to stand out. Perhaps a vibrant electric blue or acid green that signifies the 5K “high-def” concept. Using that pop of color against dark backdrops in videos, website sections, or merch will make their content instantly recognizable in feeds.

    Visual language should also reflect Oslo and Nordic roots subtly – e.g. scenic elements like fjord silhouettes or Oslo city grid patterns might appear abstractly in backgrounds or merch designs, giving local flavor without being overt.

Merchandise Direction: Thus far, COMMA’s merch offering is very limited – just a cap, crewneck, and hoodie with the COMMA logo. Those basics establish a starting point (and presumably have modest but some demand). For HE:HE, there’s an opportunity to expand and innovate in merch:

    Apparel with Conceptual Design: Move beyond just logos. Successful music merch often ties into the artist’s narrative or aesthetic. For HE:HE, merch could feature artwork from their releases (e.g., a T-shirt with an abstract representation of “Transit” – perhaps waveform art or a graphic of a city train sign for Ekeberg, tying to the track names). Another idea: since both are named Herman (HE), a tongue-in-cheek design might list “HE & HE” or something playful reflecting their duo identity.

    Limited Drops & Collabs: Taking cues from Boiler Room and others, create limited-run pieces that feel like streetwear drops. For example, a capsule collection around the release of their next EP: one high-quality jacket or soccer jersey with subtle HE:HE branding and thematic elements from the EP. Boiler Room turned merch into a “brand within a brand” by doing collabs with designers like Guccimaze
everpress.com
everpress.com
    . Similarly, HE:HE could collaborate with a visual artist (maybe Ola Vatten or another digital creator) to design a graphic tee or poster. These limited collabs create hype and could sell out among fans who value exclusivity.

    Utility and Club Culture Items: Think of merchandise that fits the lifestyle of their fans. Examples: a fanny pack or crossbody bag (popular in club/festival attire) with a small HE:HE logo – useful for festivals. Or a branded USB lanyard containing some of their DJ mix recordings (this doubles as a collectible and a tech accessory). Even earplugs case with HE:HE branding could be an interesting, scene-relevant item.

    Extend dotcomma.store successes: If the COMMA.cap and hoodie have done reasonably well, consider reinventing those for HE:HE. Perhaps a cap with “HE:HE” embroidered small on the side and a graphic on the front, or a hoodie that on the back has a large print of a live crowd shot from their show with “HE:HE” overlay. Using known good sellers (caps, hoodies) but giving them an artistic twist will likely perform well. Price them similarly (around 300-500 NOK range) to stay accessible, unless a piece is particularly premium.

    Merch as Art/Lifestyle: Maison Kitsuné and Soulection have proven a music brand can transcend into lifestyle
youtube.com
    . HE:HE can aim for this by creating merch that even non-fans might find cool. For instance, a shirt with a sleek abstract design and just a tiny “COMMA.” or “HE:HE” tag – wearable fashion, not overt advert. This broadens appeal and can bring new eyes to the brand when people ask “what’s that from?”.

DotCOMMA Ecosystem Fit: COMMA’s ecosystem currently includes a nascent apparel line and likely plans for expansions (the store has an Apparel section, hinting at more to come). HE:HE, being core artists, can be the testbed for new merch ideas within that ecosystem:

    If COMMA.store introduces more items (say, a line of graphic tees for each artist), HE:HE’s items should be flagship given their central role. Their merch could even have a special label (e.g. “HE:HE edition by COMMA”) to differentiate from generic COMMA logo merch.

    COMMA’s brand is about blending music and fashion (akin to Kitsuné) – HE:HE can reinforce this by actively wearing their merch in content (show the duo DJing in COMMA hoodies, etc., as they probably already do). If fans see the artists proudly sporting the gear, they’ll be more inclined to get it.

    One successful approach in dotcomma’s orbit is the gallery aspect – COMMA.store has a Gallery section, possibly showcasing photos or artwork. Using that, HE:HE could release limited art prints (for example, a poster of the Iris EP cover art or a photo print of them performing). These can be sold via the same store and appeal to fans as décor collectibles.

Reinventing What Works: We should examine what has worked best so far:

    Given COMMA’s low profile to date (IG <100 followers), merch hasn’t likely sold out in large volumes yet. But any feedback we have (perhaps anecdotal from events) suggests people are interested in wearing the brand. To amplify that, HE:HE merch should be visible and desirable at events: e.g., giving out some free stickers or bandanas at shows to seed the crowd, then offering nicer items for sale.

    The dotcomma.store “Label” blog shows behind-the-scenes content (like BTS video at KREAM afterparty)
dotcomma.store
    – this indicates fans enjoy inside looks. Consider tying merch to content: e.g. drop a “KREAM afterparty limited tee” with a QR code that links to the BTS video. It’s a fresh way to blend merch with content consumption.

    Reinvent packaging/experience: If COMMA has been simply shipping merch in plain packaging, HE:HE can step it up: include a small thank-you note signed by the duo in each order, or a scannable code to an exclusive mix. Little touches turn merch purchase into an experience and encourage word-of-mouth (“I bought a shirt and got a secret link to an unreleased track!”).

Visual Consistency: It’s important that all brand touchpoints for HE:HE feel unified. The website’s look, the social media graphics, and the merchandise should all speak the same language. We might create a simple brand style guide for HE:HE – specifying fonts (perhaps the same font COMMA uses to maintain brand unity), colors, logo usage, and sample graphics. This ensures that as more merch and media are produced, everything feels coherent. The Powered by Nesheim&Vatten team (who built the site) likely can help implement this consistency across the Shopify store
dotcomma.store
.

Merch Rollout Ideas:

    Start with a “HE:HE Launch Collection” soon after their next major release. A small line of 2-3 items: e.g. one tee, one hoodie, one accessory. This coincides with the EP or single release to maximize interest. Use social media teasers (“coming soon: first ever HE:HE merch drop”).

    Use scarcity smartly: limited quantities or order windows (like pre-order within 2 weeks then it’s gone) to encourage immediate action.

    Tie into COMMA events: Have the merch available at shows (people are often ready to buy merch when they’re euphoric post-set). For example, at their next headlining night, set up a small stand with the new merch.

    Collect fan input on designs via Instagram polls/Discord before finalizing – this increases the chance the designs resonate and gives fans a stake (so they’re more likely to purchase something they “voted” for).

In crafting HE:HE’s visual and merchandise strategy, the goal is to create a lifestyle around the music. As the research on competitors showed, brands like Boiler Room and Monstercat succeeded by treating merch and visuals not as afterthoughts but as integral storytelling devices. HE:HE can do the same: use every shirt, every Instagram image, every flyer as an opportunity to reinforce who they are – innovative, collaborative, cutting-edge yet rooted in the scene. Over time, a strong visual and merch presence doesn’t just generate revenue; it amplifies the music’s impact, turning casual listeners into proud supporters who wear the flag for HE:HE’s creative movement.
Strategic Collaborations & Channels

Artist & Music Collaborations: Forming strategic collabs can rapidly expand HE:HE’s reach by tapping into established fanbases:

    Within COMMA/Local Scene: Leverage their immediate network. HE:HE already has close ties with fellow COMMA artists – Violand (Hovland’s other duo project) and DECO 5000 (Marensius’s alias). A collaboration track or remix swap within this roster could cross-pollinate fans. For instance, HE:HE could do a progressive remix of a DECO 5000 trance track, releasing it as a special B-side – drawing trance fans towards HE:HE and vice versa. Additionally, collaborating with Oslo peers like Andreas Bakke or VOAN (who supported at their events
dotcomma.store
) fosters a sense of a rising local movement. When multiple local artists promote a collaborative release or event, it amplifies reach in the regional scene.

    International Allies: Target collabs with artists who share a similar ethos or sound but have their own followings. A dream example is Jeremy Olander – since HE:HE have supported him live and clearly align with his melodic progressive style
dotcomma.store
dotcomma.store
    , a collaboration or an Olander remix of an HE:HE track would lend massive credibility. Even if Olander is a stretch initially, consider rising stars like OLING from Vivrant (who already played with them
dotcomma.store
). A studio collab with OLING, released on Vivrant or COMMA, would rope in his Swedish fanbase. Other names to think about: Miss Monique (she noticed Hovland’s prior work
dotcomma.store
 – sending her an HE:HE track to possibly play on her radio show or even remix could open the door to her large online following) and Sébastien Léger (another idol they shared stage with
dotcomma.store
 – perhaps an ask for a remix or guest mix on his show).

    Cross-genre or Unexpected Collabs: To stand out, one strategy is an unexpected collaboration bridging scenes. For instance, working with a singer or band on a crossover track – maybe an indie vocalist on a progressive house ballad, akin to how Above & Beyond often feature vocalists. If the vocalist has a different fanbase (indie/alternative crowd), it could bring new listeners. Alternatively, collaborating with a techno act for a one-off (imagine HE:HE & a techno producer co-producing a track that’s harder and gets attention in that realm). This communicates versatility and can place HE:HE in multiple conversations (trance, house, techno).

    Remix Exchanges: A practical way to collaborate is trading remixes. HE:HE can remix a track by an artist and have that artist remix one of theirs. For example, a remix swap with a duo like Tinlicker or Yotto (not saying it’s easily done, but if it happened, each side promotes the other’s work to their fanbase). On a smaller scale, perhaps identify an emerging artist with a decent following and complementary style – each remixes the other’s song and they release a remix EP. This way, both get exposure to each other’s listeners.

Non-Music Collaborations:

    Fashion Brands: Given the emphasis on visual identity, linking with a fashion or streetwear brand could elevate HE:HE’s image. This could be local – maybe a Norwegian streetwear label or designer (for example, a brand like HAIK or a creative like Fredrik Tjærandsen known in Norway) to do a small merch collab. On a broader scale, even aligning with sneaker or techwear culture (imagine a one-off HE:HE design on a sneaker, or a custom DJ jacket with a fashion label) could gain press in lifestyle blogs.

    Visual Artists/Digital Creators: The Nesheim & Vatten team is an asset – perhaps they or their network can introduce digital artists (VJ artists, 3D designers) to collaborate on content. For instance, commissioning a well-known digital artist to create an animated music video or live visuals for HE:HE. If that artist has clout in the digital art sphere, the collab piece might get featured on art forums or socials, bringing those eyeballs to HE:HE. A platform like ArtStation or Behance could even be used to share these collabs, tapping creative communities.

    Influencers & YouTubers: Identify influencers whose brand fits. A few categories:

        Music Influencers: YouTubers like Dom Whiting (the “DJ on a bike” guy) or channels like MrSuicideSheep. If HE:HE can get a track featured in one of those contexts (e.g. MrSuicideSheep upload or a guest mix on a popular channel), it’s huge exposure. Approaching these outlets with their best track and a story (“rising duo from Oslo’s underground”) might catch interest.

        TikTok Creators: Perhaps a TikTok dancer known for EDM choreography could create a routine to an HE:HE track. Or travel/outdoor influencers who often use melodic music in scenic videos – offering them usage of an unreleased track for their next video (free sync) can introduce HE:HE’s sound to their followers.

        Local Personalities: Even outside music – say a popular Norwegian lifestyle YouTuber or Instagrammer – could be invited to an event or listening session. If they share that experience (like an IG story from the show or a vlog snippet), it’s organic promotion to a possibly broader local audience.

Media Outlets & Blogs:

    Electronic Music Press: Aim for coverage in publications such as Mixmag, DJ Mag, EDM.com, Dancing Astronaut, Resident Advisor. An angle focusing on “new artist duo launching their own imprint and concept in Norway” is interesting content. For instance, DJ Mag often features up-and-coming artists or label spotlights. Craft a press release that highlights the unique bits (two producers named Herman joining forces, emphasis on visuals/tech, etc.) and send to these outlets. Even a short news piece in those could significantly raise international profile.

    Niche Blogs and Sites: Electronic Groove, Deep House Amsterdam, Trance Hub, Progressive Astronaut (blog), Data Transmission etc. These cater to the exact crowds who’d dig HE:HE. Many of these accept submissions for premieres or guest mixes. A strategy: offer an exclusive track premiere or mix to one of these blogs. For example, Progressive Astronaut might premiere a new HE:HE single on their SoundCloud/YouTube – reaching tens of thousands of targeted listeners, and then cover an interview.

    Local & Regional Media: Don’t forget Norwegian press: NRK P3 (radio) might spin their track or interview them on a program. Resident Advisor has event listings and could review a COMMA event if pitched. Also, Scandinavian outlets (like GAFFA magazine in Norway/Denmark, or Attack Magazine for producers) could be approached with the story of COMMA’s emergence in Oslo. This builds regional support which is important for live opportunities.

    Community Forums: Being present (authentically) on Reddit (in threads like r/ProgressiveHouse or r/trance) and other forums (e.g. TranceAddict forums still exist) can spread word-of-mouth. Perhaps do an “We are HE:HE, AMA” on Reddit’s r/edm or similar – those often get traction if timed well (e.g., around a release or event). Also, encourage fans to share experiences – e.g. one fan posting a clip in r/aves of HE:HE’s set at a festival (“These guys from Oslo killed it”) can organically pique interest.

Channels for Distribution & Promotion:

    YouTube Channels & Streaming Shows: Aside from social media, official channels like Boiler Room (dream big – maybe one day host a Boiler Room set in Oslo) or Cercle could be targets. To start, consider approaching smaller but respected streaming platforms like Hoxton FM, United We Stream, or Lee Burridge’s All Day I Stream for a guest set. Each such feature is a new channel.

    Radio Shows/Podcasts: Many DJs run radio podcasts (e.g. Group Therapy, *Colorize, *KISS FM dance shows). Submit guest mixes or track features. If HE:HE can get a 30-min guest mix spot on a known show or a track played on e.g. Above & Beyond’s Group Therapy radio, they instantly reach tens of thousands of core genre listeners. In the trance/progressive world, that endorsement is gold. They should leverage any connections (even Miss Monique’s radio show or KREAM’s connections) to slip into those circuits.

    Digital spaces: There are Discord communities dedicated to genres (like a trance production Discord, or r/EDM’s Discord). Participating there (without spamming – maybe hosting an educational session or sharing insight into their production) can gain them respect and a following among super-users who often are tastemakers.

Festival and Event Channels: Beyond media, think of partnerships with event brands:

    Perhaps COMMA/HE:HE partners with a festival or club series for a stage takeover. For instance, if there’s an Oslo Music Week or a stage at a festival that needs curating, COMMA could propose to host it – with HE:HE as headliner and bringing in some friends. This kind of collaboration with event organizers raises profile (their name on the festival flyer as “Hosted by COMMA.”).

    Align with global initiatives like IMS (International Music Summit) or ADE (Amsterdam Dance Event) by participating in showcases or panels – even a small DJ showcase at ADE’s many events can put them on the map internationally.

In choosing collaborations and channels, strategic alignment is key: partner with those who amplify HE:HE’s brand values. For example, collabing with a big-room EDM act might reach numbers but dilute their identity, whereas collabing with a respected progressive artist enhances credibility. The good news is HE:HE is coming from an authentic place and there are plenty of aligned artists and platforms. By systematically pursuing these collaborations – musical and cultural – HE:HE can accelerate their growth and embed themselves in the fabric of the electronic music community.
Monetization Pathways

Beyond the obvious revenue streams of streaming royalties and performance fees, HE:HE (and COMMA as a whole) should explore innovative, sustainable income avenues that also strengthen fan engagement. Here are key pathways and models:

Exclusive Drops & Limited Releases: In the age of digital overload, scarcity can create value:

    Limited Digital Releases (Drops): Consider releasing certain tracks or content in limited-time or limited-quantity formats. For example, a special live edit or bootleg could be sold for 48 hours only on Bandcamp. Or an EP of club-ready “tools” (DJ friendly edits) available to purchase only during a specific week (“drop day”). This encourages immediate action from fans and those in the DJ community. The exclusivity can justify a price premium too. Monstercat does something similar with exclusive content for their subscribers; HE:HE can adapt this by making drops event-like.

    Physical Drops: Press a limited vinyl of a release (say 100 copies of Iris EP on vinyl). Vinyl sales have niche but dedicated buyers in electronic genres. These could be hand-signed or numbered to increase collector appeal. Even cassettes or special USB albums can be drops (the cost is low, and some fans love quirky formats).

    Merch Drops: As discussed earlier, treat merch in “capsule” releases. This is both a brand and monetization play – if designed well, merch can have good profit margins. By doing pre-order drops, they also mitigate risk (produce only what’s ordered). Boiler Room’s approach of seasonal collections that tie into their events
everpress.com
everpress.com
    is instructive: perhaps HE:HE/COMMA can theme drops around major gigs or releases, turning moments into merchandise.

Memberships & Subscriptions: Building recurring revenue while offering fans extra value:

    COMMA Membership (Fan Club): Launch a membership program (via Patreon, Bandcamp Subscriptions, or a custom site integration). For a monthly fee (say $5-10), members get perks: early access to new music, exclusive monthly track or remix, access to a “members-only” Discord channel or Zoom hangout, discounts on merch, guestlist consideration for shows when possible, etc. The key is to provide tangible and experiential value that justifies the recurring cost. Soulection has something akin to this with their radio and events, and Monstercat’s Gold subscription gives fans unlimited downloads and other perks. We can model a COMMA Club where HE:HE’s content is a major draw.

    Tiered Offerings: Possibly have tiers (e.g., a basic tier for early track access and a premium tier that includes, say, a quarterly merch item or one-on-one meet & greet opportunity). However, early on it might be best to keep one simple tier to not overextend promises.

    Crowdfunding Projects: If there’s a big project (say funding a US tour or a large-scale music video), consider rallying the fanbase through a Kickstarter or similar, where fans contribute in exchange for rewards (like exclusive merch or their name in credits, etc.). This isn’t a sustained model, but for one-off funding injections, it can work if you have passionate fans.

Digital Collectibles & NFTs: While the initial hype has cooled, there remains a niche for music NFTs and digital collectibles:

    If aligned with their tech-forward image, HE:HE could release a limited NFT collection linked to a track or visual art. For example, 50 NFT copies of an alternate “Iris (Extended 5K Mix)” with associated motion artwork. Each NFT could grant the owner perks (like free entry to a show or a meet & greet). Given their audience’s likely familiarity with digital trends, this could attract attention, though it should be approached authentically to avoid seeming like a cash grab. The focus should be on art and fan experience (perhaps done in collaboration with their visual artists).

    Collectible Badges: Even outside of crypto/NFT, they could issue digital badges or certificates for fans – for instance, everyone who attends their first headliner show gets a digital “HE:HE Founding Show” badge (via POAP – Proof of Attendance Protocol tokens, which are basically free NFTs). These can later be used to identify core fans and reward them (maybe badge holders get a free track later or priority on future limited drops). This builds a sense of achievement in fans and could indirectly drive loyalty (thus monetization in the long run as those fans stick around and support monetarily).

Live Experiences & Upsells: Live shows yield fees, but beyond the standard performance fee and ticket revenue (which typically goes to promoters), consider:

    Branded Events/Residencies: If COMMA or HE:HE host their own events (small club nights or showcases), that’s direct event revenue (ticket sales, maybe bar deals). A strategic timeline could include starting a quarterly COMMA night in Oslo – tickets and merch sold there become revenue streams. As their draw grows, they could do this in other cities. For instance, an “HE:HE & Friends” night where they headline and invite local DJs, with COMMA taking the door charge.

    VIP Experiences: Offer VIP tickets or packages at shows. For a bit higher price, a fan could get early venue access to watch soundcheck, a meet & greet with the duo, and maybe a signed poster. This works best as their popularity increases, but even at early stages, some fans might pay extra for a personal experience.

    Workshops/Classes: Monetize their expertise. Herman Marensius and Hovland could host a production masterclass or DJ workshop, either virtually or in person. Charge a fee for an intensive session where they break down how they made a track or give DJ lessons. Platforms like MixMaster or even privately via Zoom can facilitate this. It not only generates income but further cements their credibility. They mentioned no compromise on sound and exploration
dotcomma.store
    ; sharing that knowledge could attract aspiring producers willing to pay.

    Private Events: As reputation grows, consider carefully curated private shows (for example, a fan can “book” them for a private party at a premium price). This is a smaller market, but corporate gigs or luxury events could pay well – though these should be balanced to not tarnish underground cred (e.g., choosing brand partnerships that align with their image if any).

COMMA Pricing Models Applied: Let’s reflect on COMMA’s existing models:

    The merch pricing at ~320 NOK for caps/crews and ~470 NOK for hoodies suggests COMMA chose moderate, accessible pricing (roughly $30-$50). This likely aimed at volume and community accessibility rather than high-fashion margins. Applying this: keep base merch in that range to encourage more fans to buy. Perhaps introduce one premium item at a higher tier (like a jacket at $100+) for those willing to splurge, but maintain most items in comfortable price points.

    COMMA’s events so far (like the Smelteverket afterparty, The Villa nights) might have been low-priced or free to build community. For initial monetization, invest in growth: it can be wise to keep ticket prices low to fill venues, then monetize via bar deals or merch at the event. Once demand is high, prices can rise accordingly.

    COMMA’s releases are likely primarily streaming, possibly with free content (the blog posts and BTS videos suggest giving value for free to fans
dotcomma.store
    ). This builds goodwill. So one model that worked is content marketing – they invested in professionally presented blog stories and videos around releases. Applying this: Continue to offer free engaging content (like the BTS video) because it indirectly monetizes by drawing people into the ecosystem where they then buy merch or tickets. Essentially, content is the top of funnel, monetization happens down the line.

    COMMA’s dotcomma.store also hints at a one-stop shop approach (artists, music, merch together). Keeping that integrated is useful: when someone comes to read about HE:HE’s new release, the merch is one click away. This is already in place; optimizing it (for instance, on each blog post page about a release, show a sidebar “Shop HE:HE Merch”) can improve conversion.

Innovative Product Structures:

    Bundle Products: Sell bundles like a “Digital Concert + Merch” pack. For example, sell a ticket to a livestreamed exclusive HE:HE set that comes with a limited T-shirt. Or an album pre-order bundle where for $20 you get the digital EP plus a sticker pack and access to a listening party on Discord. Bundling increases perceived value and can increase average spend.

    Installment or Subscription for Products: If a big item is pricey (say a $120 jacket), consider offering an installment payment plan (some services allow that) to lower the barrier.

    Affiliate or Referral Rewards: Encourage fans to help sell. For instance, generate a unique discount code for key fans (via a referral program) – if they get friends to buy merch or join the membership, they earn points or free merch. This turns superfans into a quasi street team. COMMA could formalize this as an ambassador program down the road.

Fan Experiences for Revenue:

    Crowd-funding Experiences: Host unique experiences that fans pay to be part of: e.g., a “Studio hangout session” – limited to 5 fans who pay to spend an afternoon in the studio with HE:HE watching how they work. Or a “Dinner with HE:HE” VIP fundraiser. These are intimate and can be priced at a premium, with proceeds funding something specific (like album production costs, which fans might be happy to support for that access).

    Subscriptions for DJs/Producers: If HE:HE gain recognition for their production skills, there might even be a B2B angle – e.g., a Patreon tier or service where they provide monthly sample packs, project files or presets to other producers for a fee. This leverages their talent in a way that monetizes outside the typical consumer fanbase.

In choosing monetization tactics, the guiding principle should be value for the fan. Each of these ideas should be framed not as “how can we get more money?” but “how can we offer something cool that fans will want to pay for?” Done right, monetization efforts will not only generate revenue but also deepen the fan’s connection (e.g., a fan who buys a limited vinyl feels like a stakeholder in the artist’s journey).

Finally, keep things scalable and sustainable: Start small (e.g., don’t print 500 hoodies, print 50 and gauge demand). Use data (what sells out, what lingers) to inform the next move. By gradually layering these revenue streams, HE:HE can build from a passion project into a financially viable act, all while keeping creative and audience autonomy. The combination of diverse income (merch, digital, experiences, memberships) can collectively create a robust foundation that’s not overly reliant on any single source like streaming (which in itself might be modest until they hit millions of plays).
Strategic Timeline for Rollout

To execute the above strategies cohesively, here is a proposed 12-18 month roadmap for HE:HE’s launch and development, with key milestones and phases:

Q4 2025: Foundation & Soft Launch

    Brand Finalization (Month 1): Finalize HE:HE visual identity (logo, color scheme, press photos). Prepare a short artist bio and press kit highlighting their unique positioning (Oslo duo, progressive/trance fusion, founders of COMMA.) – this will be used in outreach. Begin quietly seeding social media content: teaser posts of the logo, clips from past shows (e.g., the KREAM afterparty BTS
dotcomma.store
    ) to stir curiosity among existing followers. Internally, set up the infrastructure: Discord server creation, Patreon account (but not launched to public yet), and merch prototypes ordered.

    Release of New Single (Month 2): Drop the first post-Iris EP single as HE:HE. This could be a standalone track to keep momentum. Coordinate a premiere with a blog (e.g., Progressive Astronaut)
dotcomma.store
    and a push to playlists. Simultaneously, launch the pre-save campaign and hype on socials (short preview video on IG/TikTok). This single’s release date can effectively serve as HE:HE’s “official” debut as a duo brand, so ensure coverage – send press release to EDM media a week prior.

    Merch Pre-sale (Month 2): Alongside the single, unveil a small “HE:HE Launch” merch capsule on dotcomma.store – for example, a t-shirt and cap. Use the new single’s artwork or theme in the design to tie it together. Open a 2-week pre-order to gauge demand (ensuring production matches interest). Promote this on social media and in the COMMA email newsletter (if one exists, or start one with this announcement).

Q1 2026: Growth & Content Blitz

    Social Media Campaigns (Month 3-4): Initiate a TikTok/Instagram campaign leveraging year-end and New Year themes. For instance, create a TikTok series “HE:HE’s Guide to Progressive House Classics” – where each day they feature a classic track that influenced them. This provides engaging content around the holidays when people scroll a lot. In parallel, use the growth of #ElectronicMusic on TikTok (now global)
    routenote.com
    by doing a hashtag challenge – e.g., #HEHEdrop with users showing their best dance moves to the new single’s drop.

    Community Building (Month 3-4): Publicly launch the Discord server and drive sign-ups (“first 100 members get a special role”). Host a launch event on Discord: a live AMA or a listening party of the new single and maybe an unreleased track as a reward. Also, begin a monthly email newsletter – January edition could recap the single’s success and tease upcoming plans.

    Live Presence (Month 4-5): By now, aim to have a couple of significant gig bookings. Perhaps an EP release party at The Villa or a similar venue, co-hosted by COMMA. If possible, also secure a slot at a winter festival or conference (even a small stage at ADE’s off-season events or a regional fest). Use these shows to generate content (pro photographers, video snippets) and as proof points to pitch for more gigs.

Q2 2026: Major Release & Collaboration

    Debut HE:HE EP (Month 6): Release a major EP or second EP on COMMA (COMMA.00X). This should be a headline release – 3-4 tracks including a collab or a high-profile remix. For example, include a remix by an established name (perhaps a friendly local hero or a mid-tier international artist). Leading up to it, drop one track as a single with video content (maybe an animated visualizer from the virtual environment). Do a release party livestream on YouTube or Twitch for global fans on release day. Ensure media coverage by offering interviews around this EP (that Story Behind Iris EP blog interview format can be pitched to other outlets now)
dotcomma.store
dotcomma.store
    .

    Collaboration Single (Month 7): Shortly after the EP, keep momentum by releasing the collaborative single (if not part of EP) – e.g., HE:HE x OLING track. This can be on COMMA or if OLING’s label Vivrant is interested, even better (released on Vivrant to tap their network). This acts as a bridge to new audiences. Promote via both artists’ channels; maybe do an IG Live together talking about how the collab came about.

    Festival Circuit Pitch (Month 6-8): With a solid EP out and rising profile, start pitching to late summer festivals and fall events. Use any press quotes or streaming numbers as leverage (“supported by X DJ, Y streams in 2 months”). Target key festivals where progressive/melodic fits – locally (Sommerøya, Findings) and regionally (Amsterdam Dance Event 2026, a stage at Creamfields or Luminosity for trance, etc.). This is the time when promoters are booking summer lineups, so having the EP out helps.

Q3 2026: Expanding Reach & Monetization Launch

    International Gigs & Mini-Tour (Month 9-10): Ideally by mid-2026, secure a few international gigs – maybe a London club debut, a Berlin gig (HØR session or a support slot at Watergate), and a Stockholm date (given Swedish connections). Bundle these as a mini-tour and promote it as HE:HE’s first international foray. This not only earns performance fees but also marketing clout (“Oslo duo goes international”). Document the tour heavily – hire a videographer for a tour recap video to post on YouTube (fans love tour documentaries, and it’s great promo material).

    Merch Drop 2 – Summer/Fall Collection (Month 9): Based on earlier merch performance, launch a more elaborate collection perhaps tied to the EP or tour. Introduce one or two new items (e.g., a hoodie, a tank for festival season, and a limited poster). Since COMMA.store now has more visitors post-EP, this drop could do better. Consider doing a pop-up merch stall or meet & greet at one of the tour stops to sell merch in person (monetizing tour hype).

    Monetization Initiatives (Month 10): Launch the membership program (COMMA Club or HE:HE Patreon) once a sizable core fanbase exists. By month 10, with an EP, collabs, and shows, identify the ~50-100 super-fans who engage a lot (they comment, they’re in Discord, etc.). Roll out a Patreon with a soft launch targeting them. Offer a killer welcome package (e.g., Patreon subscribers get an unreleased track immediately and a discount code). Also, perhaps host a special “founding members” livestream for anyone who joins in the first month. Aim to convert a chunk of those core fans into paying members.

    NFT/Collectible Experiment (Month 10-11): If going the NFT route, this is a good time to try a small drop while buzz from tour and EP remains. Release a single as an NFT collectible or do the POAP for those tour attendees to test waters. Keep it low-key and learning-focused. If not NFTs, maybe an alternate approach: release a limited live album (recordings from tour sets) exclusively on Bandcamp for a price.

Q4 2026: Consolidation & Scale-Up

    Reflection and PR (Month 12): Around the one-year mark of launch, do a press outreach again, framing it as a one-year retrospective: how HE:HE went from launching COMMA’s first release to playing internationally in a year. This narrative can be pitched as an article or a guest essay on a site like Medium or LinkedIn (from the perspective of creative entrepreneurs) and shared on socials – it strengthens brand story and credibility. It’s also a nice way to re-engage media who covered the launch, updating them on progress (maybe DJ Mag could do a “Ones to Watch: One Year Later” follow-up).

    Bigger Collaborations (Month 12-15): Use the momentum to reach even higher on collabs – maybe now approach that dream collaborator (Jeremy Olander or a Anjunadeep artist). Even if it’s a remix for them or by them, try to secure one marquee collaboration in this period. That can lead into year 2 with a bang (e.g., HE:HE remixes [Big Name]’s track which gets attention).

    Album or Major Project Tease (Month 15-18): If all has gone well, by late 2026 the idea of a full album or a major audio-visual project could be tangible. Start laying groundwork: perhaps announce that a debut album is in production, or that a new concept show (with enhanced visuals or a residency) is coming. Use this to keep fans excited long-term. This might coincide with expanding monetization – for instance, pre-orders for an album (with deluxe packages) or crowdfunding for a special project if needed.

    Scaling the Business (Month 15-18): Evaluate revenue streams. If merch is consistently selling out, consider investing more in it (maybe partnering with a fulfillment service to broaden reach). If membership is growing, poll those members for what more they’d pay for, and implement upgrades. Essentially, turn successful experiments into regular features. Also, this might be time to bring on a booking agent or manager if not already – to capitalize on their growth and offload operational tasks so the duo can focus on creative and strategic decisions.

Throughout this timeline, it’s vital to remain adaptive. If a particular strategy isn’t resonating by mid-2026 (say TikTok growth is slow but YouTube is exploding), adjust focus accordingly. Regularly gather feedback – from fans (via Discord or polls) and from data metrics – to inform the next quarter’s plan.

This roadmap interweaves creative output (music releases, performances) with marketing pushes (social campaigns, content) and commercial initiatives (merch, memberships). By timing them in sync (e.g., merch drops with releases, content pushes around tours), each element boosts the others. Over ~18 months, HE:HE should transition from a fresh duo into a multifaceted brand – with a recognizable identity, a devoted community, diversified income streams, and industry relationships – all of which set the stage for longevity and larger success in subsequent years.
