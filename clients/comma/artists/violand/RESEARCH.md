# Violand – Comprehensive Artist Profile

## 1. Artist Identity & Background

Violand is an Oslo-based electronic music duo consisting of producer Herman Hovland and vocalist/composer Jørgen Vigre. They create progressive electronic music characterized by a balance of club-ready energy and introspective atmosphere. Hovland handles the cinematic production and warm, bassy grooves, while Vigre contributes haunting vocal textures that add emotional depth to their tracks. The two artists forged their project after years of shared studio time and a mutual love for progressive house, which heavily influences their sound. Their polished style is rooted in rhythmic drive and melodic tension, shaped by Oslo’s electronic scene and progressive house influences ranging from melodic techno to trance.

Both members bring experience: Hovland has over a decade in Oslo’s music scene and also records trance under the alias "DECO 5000". Vigre’s ethereal vocals give Violand a distinct identity, more like an instrument than traditional lyrics. The duo cites progressive house as a key influence and operates within Oslo’s growing melodic community.
