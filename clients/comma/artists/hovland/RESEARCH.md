# Hovland – Artist Profile and Career Timeline

## Background
Herman Hovland is a progressive house producer and DJ from Oslo, Norway. Before adopting his current moniker, he released music as **Von Dahl** and as part of the duo **Violand**. The Von Dahl project began around 2016 and produced several singles with collaborator Victor Ameln, including "Confusion" (2022), "Gatekeeper" (2023), "Antarctica" (2023) and "So Sad" (2024). "Antarctica" became a minor breakthrough, accumulating more than 150,000 streams and gaining attention from progressive house circles.

In late 2021 Hovland teamed up with Jørgen Vigre to form Violand. Their debut EP "Elude" appeared on INU Musika and was soon followed by singles like "Sweven" that earned DJ support from names such as Miss Monique. Violand continued to release on respected melodic labels and scheduled a "Both of Us EP" for Freegrant Music in May 2025. These early projects built Hovland's reputation for emotive, progressive grooves.

## Performances
Hovland has become a fixture in Oslo's club scene with regular appearances at venues such as The Villa and Jæger. He has shared the stage with international acts like Jeremy Olander and Sébastien Léger, building credibility among progressive house fans. Throughout 2024 he and Marensius refined their material in long back‑to‑back DJ sets, culminating in a five‑hour showcase at The Villa's Sweatshop room in March 2025.

Notable events include supporting Norwegian act KREAM at an afterparty at Smelteverket and hosting a three‑way set with OLING in May 2025. These performances highlight Hovland's ability to curate energetic nights that promote the COMMA. label and connect with both underground and mainstream crowds.

## Strategy
Hovland co‑founded COMMA. to maintain creative control and foster a community around melodic progressive house. The label serves as a platform for his solo releases, collaborations with Marensius, and projects like Violand. By testing tracks in clubs before release, Hovland fine‑tunes his sound for maximum dance‑floor impact.

Going forward, he plans to expand the COMMA. brand through a steady release schedule, further collaborations and showcase events. The upcoming "Both of Us EP" by Violand will broaden his reach on established labels, while new solo material and joint projects with Marensius will continue to define COMMA.'s identity. Festival appearances, remixes and digital content are all opportunities to grow his audience while staying true to the label's experimental yet melodic vision.
