# COMMA

This folder holds the project materials for **COMMA**, a music label and management venture. The repository here is the base import only—no changes have been made to the code yet.

Use the subfolders to organise everything related to the client:

- **contracts/** – agreements and legal documents
- **meetings/** – meeting notes and agendas
- **strategy/** – plans and roadmaps
- **design/** – artwork, graphics and other design assets
- **website/** – website code and configuration
- **deliverables/** – final files handed over to the client

All content is owned by COMMA. Further work on branding, design and technical setup will expand on this foundation.
