### Logo Standards
- Use the approved **SVG logo** from `docs/brand-assets/logo/`.
- Ensure there is clear space around the logo (about the height of the logo).
- Avoid stretching, recoloring, or distorting the logo.
- Create variants (e.g., monochrome, squared) as needed for different backgrounds.

### Color Palette
- Use the official brand colors (see `docs/brand-assets/colors/`).
- Stick to the palette in all assetsâ€”print, web, and social.

### Typography & Imagery
- Apply brand fonts in client-facing materials.
- Use professional-quality imagery for social and web content.
