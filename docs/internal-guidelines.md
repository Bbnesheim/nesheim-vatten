## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Identity & Asset Use

### Logo Standards
- Use the approved **SVG logo** from `docs/brand-assets/logo/`.
- Ensure there is clear space around the logo (about the height of the logo).
- Avoid stretching, recoloring, or distorting the logo.
- Create variants (e.g., monochrome, squared) as needed for different backgrounds.

### Color Palette
- Use the official brand colors (see `docs/brand-assets/colors/`).
- Stick to the palette in all assetsâ€”print, web, and social.

### Typography & Imagery
- Apply brand fonts in client-facing materials.
- Use professional-quality imagery for social and web content.

## ðŸš€ Workflow & Project Management

### Git Practices
- **Always branch** for new client work with `git checkout -b feature/<client-name>-<task>`.
- PRs should be reviewed, approved, and linked to your PR template.
- Code should be clean, tested, and documented.

### Client Folder Structure
Each client gets their own structured folder under `clients/`, with these subfolders:

- `contracts/`
- `deliverables/`
- `design/`
- `meetings/`
- `strategy/`
- `website/`

Refer to `folder-structure.txt` for the complete directory tree.
