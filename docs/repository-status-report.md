## Website Assets Overview

There are 32 JavaScript modules under `docs/website/website-v1/assets`. Prior to
this update only four of them had automated tests. Additional Jest tests now
cover `details-modal.js` and `pubsub.js`, but most modules remain untested.

Attempting to run `npm run build` followed by `npx webpack-bundle-analyzer
dist/assets/bundle-stats.json` failed in this environment because webpack and its
dependencies were not installed. Bundle size information could therefore not be
generated.
